// Table names are generally spelled in PascalCase. Column names in camelCase.
// Model names should use the singular form (for example, User instead of user, users or Users)

// Relation scalar naming conventions
// Because a relation scalar field always belongs to a relation field, the following naming convention is common:
// Relation field: author
// Relation scalar field: authorId (relation field name + Id)
